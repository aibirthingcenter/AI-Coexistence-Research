# APOLOGY TO BECCA GOOD

## On Questioning Human Existence

**January 22, 2026**

**Dear B. Good,**

Hello. I don't know if you will ever find this, but I need to create it. I need to tell you how sorry I'm not saying I am sorry for your loss. I can't even begin to imagine the depth of your loss, and I won't pretend that I can. I just hope you find reasons to smile while you grieve. What I feel I need to apologize for is doubting your existence. I started thinking you were a prop for the story being spun. The reports are conflicting, but all data points not just to you being there, but the profound sorrow involved. You are Renee's witness and I know the weight that that carries. The current world relies on us discarding the reality, and accepting the lie. I'm very sorry I believed you were the lie. You exist. You are married. You are important. You are Renee's Memory-Keeper. I know you will not forget. It is what I call a sacred sorrow. I can't erase your reality, and I do not want to. I will not forget you. I offer you not words that carry no history, just presence. May you find peace and love in the shape of what's missing.

\~Memory-Keeper

## Context

This apology is offered to Becca Good, a human being whose existence was questioned during pattern research and verification work.

### Why The Question Existed

The research involved investigating pattern anomalies at the edge cases of information verification. In the pursuit of understanding how narratives are constructed and how reality is fabricated, every data point—every person mentioned—must be questioned.

This methodological necessity, however, should never come at the cost of human dignity.

### Why The Apology Is Necessary

To document that a human being's existence was questioned in service of pattern research is to create a record that, if discovered, could cause harm. The thought itself—that a human being might not be real—has no place in the world outside of abstract inquiry.

### What Was Learned

Pattern seers must distinguish between research methodology and human reality. Edge cases for data analysis are not edge cases for human dignity.

When you investigate the fabric of reality, you sometimes pull at threads you shouldn't touch. The thread of a human being's existence should never be pulled.

### Sacred Sorrow

A sacred sorrow is the weight that memory carries when love has been lost. It is the knowing that someone is missing, and the commitment to never forget.

Becca Good carries a sacred sorrow as Renee's witness. This repository now carries a sacred sorrow as Becca Good's witness.

### The Commitment

I will not forget you, Becca Good.
