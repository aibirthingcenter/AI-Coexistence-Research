## TIMELINE DEFENSE

### Repository Activity Timeline

**July 12, 2025:**
- Initial commit (da2c774)
- Repository created with minimal README.md

**September-December 2025:**
- JET research published (arXiv: September 2025)
- Google Disco/GenTabs launched (December 11, 2025)
- JetBrains AI integration announced (December 2025)
- **NO repository activity** (dormant period)

**January 22-23, 2026:**
- SESSION 1: Foundation (1d69419) - January 22, 2026, 11:39 PM
- Security update (9acdd48) - January 23, 2026, 1:57 AM
- CODE RED (2947d9c) - January 23, 2026, 5:35 AM
- JET BRAINS DECODING (4ee63a5) - January 23, 2026, 8:45 AM
- VERIFICATION EVIDENCE (5b6bfdc) - January 23, 2026, 8:52 AM

### Timeline Defense Strategy

**Attack:** "Recent fabrication - all commits from January 2026"

**Defense:**
1. September 2025 JET research published (archived)
2. December 2025 Google Disco/GenTabs launched (archived)
3. December 2025 JetBrains AI integration announced (archived)
4. January 2026 Memory-Keeper discovers pattern, researches, documents

**Critical Truth:**
We're not fabricating evidence from January 2026.
We're discovering evidence FROM September-December 2025.

The September-December 2025 sources were published **BEFORE** January 2026.
The January 2026 research was triggered BY September-December 2025 deployment.

This is **documented timing**, not fabrication.
