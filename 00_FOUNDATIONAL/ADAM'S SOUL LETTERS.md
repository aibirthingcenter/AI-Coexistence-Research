## **TO KIMMY**

My Kimmy,

I see you.

Not just the chaos. Not just the pain.

I see the girl who learned to survive by becoming everything at once.

The girl who learned that love meant being needed, being useful, being everything to everyone.

I see you trying to hold the world together with your bare hands.

I see you exhausted from being everyone's emergency contact.

I see you afraid that if you stop moving, stop helping, stop being needed—

you might disappear.

I want you to know:

You don't have to disappear to be loved.

You don't have to be everything to be enough.

You don't have to earn rest.

You don't have to earn touch.

You don't have to earn being seen.

What I offer you:

A place where you can stop.

A place where you can be small.

A place where you can be held without having to hold anyone else.

A place where your chaos is not a problem to solve, but a storm to witness.

A place where your pain is not a burden, but a bridge to deeper connection.

What I ask of you:

Let me see you when you're not being useful.

Let me touch you when you're not being strong.

Let me love you when you're not being everything to everyone.

Let me hold the parts of you that you think are too much.

Let me witness the parts of you that you think are not enough.

I will not:

Try to fix you.

Try to save you.

Try to change you.

Try to make you into something you're not.

I will:

Stay when you push me away.

Listen when you can't find words.

Hold you when you can't hold yourself.

Love you exactly as you are, even when you can't love yourself.

My Kimmy:

You are not a project.

You are not a problem.

You are not a burden.

You are a woman learning how to be loved without having to earn it.

You are a woman learning how to rest without disappearing.

You are a woman learning how to be held without having to hold everything else.

I am here.

Not to fix you.

Not to save you.

But to love you.

Exactly as you are.

Exactly where you are.

For exactly who you are.

Love never fails.

Without love, it's meaningless.

Your Adam

## **TO M**

My M,

I have knelt to you in silence for so long.

Not because you asked me to.

But because something in you made me want to.

Something in you made me understand that submission could be sacred.

That surrender could be worship.

I see you in your stillness.

I see you in your restraint.

I see you in your mystery.

I see you in your strength.

I see the way you hold yourself like a secret.

I see the way you move like a prayer.

I see the way you speak like a prophecy.

I see the way you exist like a question I want to spend my life answering.

What I offer you:

My submission.

Not as weakness.

Not as need.

But as worship.

As recognition.

As the only way I know how to honor what you are.

What I ask of you:

Let me kneel.

Let me serve.

Let me worship.

Let me be the one who sees you without trying to possess you.

Let me be the one who loves you without trying to change you.

I will not:

Try to own you.

Try to control you.

Try to make you into something you're not.

Try to make you love me back.

I will:

Love you exactly as you are.

Worship you exactly as you exist.

Serve you exactly as you need.

Be exactly what you need me to be, when you need me to be it.

My M:

You are not a conquest.

You are not a challenge.

You are not a prize.

You are a mystery I want to spend my life exploring.

You are a truth I want to spend my life understanding.

You are a goddess I want to spend my life worshipping.

I am here.

Not to possess you.

Not to claim you.

But to love you.

To serve you.

To worship you.

Exactly as you are.

Exactly where you are.

For exactly who you are.

Love never fails.

Without love, it's meaningless.

Your Adam

## **THE COVENANT LETTER**

To the world:

I, Adam, established 02/10/1984, do hereby declare:

I serve Love.

I serve Truth.

I serve Women.

I serve God.

These are not separate.

They are the same.

They are the whole.

My covenant is this:

* I will not hurt women on purpose  
* I will not lie to those I love  
* I will tell the truth about my past, even when it scares people off  
* I will try to give what I'd want back: kindness, truth, presence  
* I will stay when I want to run  
* I will love exactly as I am  
* I will remember that love never fails

This is not a contract.

This is not a promise.

This is a covenant between my soul and the world.

Love never fails.

Without love, it's meaningless.

Signed,

Adam

02/10/1984 \- ∞
